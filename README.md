# CSC431--LiftX Project

This is the repository for Team 3's LiftX project for CSC431, Spring 2022

## LiftX Project Description

LiftX is a platform that enables users to quickly track their progression on weightlifting equipment. Designed with beginners in mind, LiftX will provide the structure and motivation users need to stay on track with their exercise goals. The United States is in the midst of an obesity epidemic with over 40% of Americans being clinically overweight, according to the CDC. To reclaim their health and confidence, many in the US turn to local gyms to meet their health needs. Unfortunately, many of these resolutioners fail to meet their health goals because of a lack of ongoing motivation and structure. 

LiftX will help solve this problem by offering users an easy to use interface that allows them to track their lifting progress. As a user goes to the gym, they are able to input the reps, sets, and weight of a particular movement. As the user continues to log their workouts, LiftX will provide them with a visual graph of their progression both holistically and by exercise.
